1) Overview
- 2. creating a symbol table that handles variable declarations
- 8. code generation for the decaf grammar specified in the homework

2) Design Plan
- 2. since question 2 builds upon question 1, we decided to do question 1 as well for a better understanding of question 2
- 8. majority of our time was spend on question 8, as it was the most complexed.
	 we ran into some problems with llvm versions, which delayed progress for sometime.
	 the extra week gave us a chance to get back on track, in the end we did need to use one grace day to finish.
	 but it is completed.
