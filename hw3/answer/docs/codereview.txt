---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding bugs
Bugs found in code review require much less effort to find & fix than bugs found in QA/testing.
Coding style
Improving code quality
Teaching best practices
Code consistency (can't tell the author from the code)
Learning code
What is missing
Efficiency

Code Review Checklist
------------------------------
https://www.liberty.edu/media/1414/%5B6401%5Dcode_review_checklist.pdf

Used above link to check areas of the program such as structure,documentation,variables,loops and branches

e.g.
Does the code completely and correctly implement the design?
Does the code conform to any pertinent coding standards?
Is the code well-structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?

--------------
decaf-ast.cc
--------------
some instances of commented out code that still remains
function names could be confusing at times

Overall, the code is following a consistent code style, it is readable, and maintainable

--------------
expr-codegen.lex
--------------
very precise and well defined grammar
lists everything required properly

Overall, the code is easy to read top to bottom.

--------------
expr-codegen.y
--------------
has some comments for clarification
still some debugging lines commented out

Overall, format is easy to follow and consist, easy to find what is needed.
