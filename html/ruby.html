		<h3>Node.js VS Ruby on Rails</h3>
	</div>
		<p>Ruby on Rails is a full stack web application framework written in Ruby. Many developers are switching over from Ruby on Rails to Node.js, so we thought it was a good idea to compare the two technologies.</p>
		<p>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment built on the Google V8 JavaScript engine. Applications are written in JavaScript, while Node is not. It is possible to run a web server as it contains a built-in HTTP server library. The whole goal of Node.js is to build server-side and network applications.</p>
		<p>What are the main differences between Ruby on Rails and Node.js? Node.js has a slightly steeper learning curve than Rails, whereas Ruby is easy to learn. However, if a developer already knows JavaScript, then Node.js is much easier to learn. Since Rails is older and therefore has a larger user base than Node.js, one can find more documentation for Ruby on Rails than Node.js. However, Node.js is being used more and more and it will eventually catch up with Ruby on Rails. At the moment, Ruby on Rails has more built-in functions that Node.js does. Like I said before, this type of thing will change with time as Node.js matures. Node.js is faster than Rails, thanks to the V8 engine. Certain sites have experienced more than 10 times increase in speed after using Node.js. Node.js has better scalability. Node.js is not a framework, while Ruby on Rails is. You can write the front-end, the back-end, and the database all in Node.js, whereas with Ruby, you cannot. This makes Node.js a bit more flexible than Ruby on Rails.</p>
