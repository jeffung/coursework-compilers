		<h3><b>Node.js compared with PHP:</b><br></h3>

	</div>

		

		<p>


PHP is a server-side scripting language and Node.js is is used to create server-side

applications in JavaScript. PHP requires a server (such as Apache) to accept incoming 

requests and to deliver responses, whereas Node.js does not.<br><br>


PHP has package management systems PEAR and Composer similar to (and inspired by) 

Node.js's NPM package manager. Unlike NPM, not all PHP modules can be found through PEAR

or Composer. <br><br>


Unlike Node.js, PHP does not use a non-blocking I/O architecture so multithreading is

required for developing applications that process multiple events at once. External 

modules exist that allow multi-threading in Node.js. <br><br>


Node.js is faster than PHP due to it being built on the Google Chrome V8 engine and its 

non-blocking architecture. PHP's file and database systems are its performance 

bottlenecks. <br><br>


PHP was built to make it easy to use MySQL and other SQL databases. Node.js has modules 

that allow it to access almost any type of database, but it works best with NoSQL 

databases that store data as JSON since Node is based on JavaScript so no intermediary

data conversions are required. PHP has libraries that allow it to interact with NoSQL

databases.<br><br>


Node.js shares the same syntax as JavaScript, so it is easy for JavaScript developers to 

learn Node.js and implement a full stack of JavaScript code as opposed to learning PHP and

having to make client side JavaScript interact with server-side PHP.</p>
