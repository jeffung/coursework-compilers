Checklist used to check areas of the program. Areas such as branches, structure, documentation, variables, and loops.

Examples:

-Is the code readable? 
-Does the code completely and correctly implement the design?
-Does the code conform to coding standards?
-Is the code well structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?
